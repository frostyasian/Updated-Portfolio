                I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I work in the service industry, am an avid
                  rock climber and delve into photography in my spare time. I started waiting tables when I was about 15 and
                  it has definitely taught me very important social and life skills
                  growing up. From patience to multitasking and just being able to handel people when situations randomly arise. I also rock climb whenever I am not working. Climbing provided challenges that were not only physical but
                  also mental. It is like a giant puzzle that has multitude ways to solve them, similar to a rubik's cube. It forces you to think outside of the box and keep an open mind that not everyone climbs the same style. It is a very diverse and upcoming sport.  Photography is something I have always had an interest in. I started learning photography with an old film camera my parents had laying around and just learning the mechanics of film was the starting point in my love for photography. It was a learning curve and it taught me to focus on waiting for that moment where you thought was important and right to capture. Now I shoot for fun and its a hobby I thoroughly enjoy. Now onto coding ...
